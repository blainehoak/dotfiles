# Dotfiles

This is my personal collection of dotfiles to configure my environment. 

### yadm

Most of the setup can be done by running the yadm bootstrap file, but there is some additional customization after that.

### Slack

Open Preferences -> Themes and copy in the values in the slack.md file.

### Firefox

Install the addons listed in firefox.md.
